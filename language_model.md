## Employ LM in the downstream task

&#x1F4D8; **Context-specific language modeling for human trafficking detection from online advertisements**

+ Conference: ACL2019
+ Comment: This paper introduces a new task called human trafficking detection, which is a text classification problem. In this work, they employ the BERT as a kind of feature model to encode the text.


&#x1F4D8; **Fine-tuning Pre-Trained Transformer Language Models to Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction**

+ Conference: ACL2019
+ Comment: Relation Extraction is a task of identifying the relations between concepts appeared in text. The distantly supervised RE is a multi-instances learning problem, which uses a set of sentences that contains the same concepts to predict the relation between them.
