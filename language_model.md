## Employ LM in the downstream task

**Context-specific language modeling for human trafficking detection from online advertisements**

Conference: ACL2019
did: This paper introduces a new task called human trafficking detection, which is a text classification problem. In this work, they employ the BERT as a kind of feature model to encode the text.


**Fine-tuning Pre-Trained Transformer Language Models to Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction**

Relation Extraction is a task of identifying the relations between concepts appeared in text. The distantly supervised RE is a multi-instances learning problem, which uses a set of sentences that contains the same concepts to predict the relation between them.
